The player can brake his car by holding down the Space key on the keyboard. Apart from that, players can also use the Esc key to pause this game. On the Pause menu, there are options to continue the game, restart the game, and return to the Main Menu. In this Car on Mission game, there are 2 levels to play. At level 1, the player will be faced with an asphalt track with various obstacles, such as slopes and fallen trees. In addition, there is an elastic wall where if the player hits the wall, the car will bounce. The following is a screenshot of the game as an overview of level 1:

Level 2 can only be played after players complete level 1 first. At level 2, the player will be faced with a fairly slippery snow track with more and more difficult obstacles than at level 1. At level 2, the player can also shoot bullets that will come out of the muzzle of the car by pressing the left mouse button, pressing the K, or pressing the Ctrl key (left-side) on the keyboard. These bullets are used to destroy boulders blocking the path. There are 3 types of stones, "ordinary stones" which will be destroyed after 10 shots, "big stones" which will be destroyed after 20 shots, and "very large stones" which will be destroyed after 30 shots, where this "very large stone" must be destroyed to be able to win at this level 2.
